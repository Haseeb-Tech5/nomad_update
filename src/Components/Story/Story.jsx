          The inception of Nomad Nurses arose from our personal experiences
          within the dental profession. We encountered difficulties in booking
          and securing nurses, realizing that nurses lacked the means and access
          to practices seeking locum professionals. Through the creation of our
          groundbreaking app and website, we successfully filled this void,
          facilitating communication between locum nurses and dental practices.
          As practicing dentists without a dedicated nurse, we recognized the
          vital significance of this venture for the dental industry. Our
          objective is to streamline the process of booking dental nurses for
          practices, ensuring a seamless experience and enabling nurses to find
          opportunities with the touch of a button.
